{"name":"Lilia","tagline":"A Scheme-like programming language running in the browser.","body":"### What is Lilia?\r\nLilia is a [Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29)-like programming language with an interpreter created to be easily accessible. You can access the interpreter from everywhere using a modern web browser.\r\n\r\n### What is the difference with the other online Scheme interpreters?\r\nMaybe you have already used the online interpreters of [repl.it](http://repl.it/languages/Scheme) or even [قلب](http://qlb-repl.herokuapp.com/) (pronounced 'alb). They are quite great to check whether some simple code works. What Lilia tries to do (or plans to do) is to provide the programmer with more user-friendly messages and helpful tools.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you found a problem or have a suggestion for Lilia, please leave a comment at [https://github.com/ipelovski/lilia/issues](https://github.com/ipelovski/lilia/issues).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
